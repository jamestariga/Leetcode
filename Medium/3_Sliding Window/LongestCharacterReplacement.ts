Intuition
The idea is to maintain a window (substring) and adjust it as you iterate through the string. The goal is to find the longest substring with the same character, allowing for at most k replacements.

Approach
HashMap Initialization:

hashMap is initialized to keep track of the frequency of characters in the current window.

Variable Initialization:

longest is initialized to track the length of the longest substring.
maxFreq is initialized to track the maximum frequency of any character encountered in the current window.
leftPointer is initialized as the starting point of the sliding window.

Main Loop:

The algorithm iterates through the string using the right pointer.
For each character encountered, it increments its frequency in the HashMap.

Max Frequency Update:

maxFreq is updated to reflect the maximum frequency of any character encountered so far.

Dynamic Window Adjustment:

If at any point, the size of the window minus the maximum frequency exceeds the allowed replacements k, it means we need to shrink the window from the left side.
The left pointer is moved, and the frequency of the character at that position is decremented.

Longest Substring Update:

longest is updated to keep track of the length of the longest substring with the same character.

Result:

Finally, the function returns the length of the longest substring with the same character, allowing for at most k replacements.

Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) with an upper bound of O(26) for the HashMap.
