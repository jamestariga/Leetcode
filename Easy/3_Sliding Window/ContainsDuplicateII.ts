// Approach
// The solution uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the elements within a distance of k from the current element. The sliding window is implemented using a Set data structure, which allows us to efficiently check if an element is already in the window.

// For each element in the input array nums, we first check if the element is already in the Set. If it is, then we have found a duplicate within k distance and we can return true. This is because the Set only contains elements within a distance of k from the current element, so if the current element is already in the Set, it must be a duplicate within k distance.

// If the current element is not in the Set, we add it to the Set. We then check if the size of the Set is greater than k. If it is, we remove the element that is k distance away from the current element to maintain the size of the sliding window. This ensures that the Set always contains at most k elements, representing a sliding window of size k.

// If we reach the end of the array without finding any duplicates within k distance, we return false.

// Explanation with example
// Suppose we have the following input:

// nums = [1, 2, 3, 1];
// k = 3;
// We want to check if there are any duplicates in the nums array such that the distance between the two duplicates is at most k.

// We start by initializing an empty Set to keep track of the elements within a distance of k from the current element.

// let set = new Set<number>();

// Next, we iterate over each element in the nums array. For the first element nums[0], which is 1, we check if it is already in the Set. Since the Set is empty, it is not. So we add it to the Set.

// set = {1};

// We then move on to the next element, nums[1], which is 2. We check if it is already in the Set. It is not, so we add it to the Set.

// set = {1, 2};

// We continue this process for the next element, nums[2], which is 3. We check if it is already in the Set. It is not, so we add it to the Set.

// set = {1, 2, 3};

// Now we have reached the fourth element, nums[3], which is 1. We check if it is already in the Set. It is, so we have found a duplicate within a distance of k and we can return true.

// This is how the solution works. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the elements within a distance of k from the current element and checks if there are any duplicates within that window.

// Complexity
// Time complexity: O(n)
// Space complexity: O(1)
